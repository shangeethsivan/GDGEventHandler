# GDGEventOrganiser

This App was created in a Day for smoothening the registration process at GDG Devfest Chennai 2022 (IN-PERSON EVENT). https://devfest.gdgchennai.in/

I know creating an App in a Day is something interesting. 

### Main Features of the app

* Orgranisers can Check IN attendees with check in code from townscript/other source
* QR Code scanner for scanning the code that townscript has provided
* User Check OUT screen for the user mainly used for providing goodies for the attendees (To avoid giving two goodies for a single attendee)
* Live Check IN count for organisers
* Features are subject to change will be creating a slack channel for this project and will share the link here interested ppl can join and contribute.

### Tech Stack
* Architecture wise dont expect anything since we rushed in creating it.
* Compose for UI 
* Firebase Firestore for DB
* Planning to properly move this to a MVVM architecture.

### Features Planned / Under Dev: 
* Download Checked in users data as CSV File.
* Use NavHost in compose and NavRail 
* Move all pages to follow MVVM architecture 
* Use Hilt for DI
